## Queries/instructions to manipulate rows and cols

### Create rows/entries/entities

Insert data.

Create data inside our tables

`INSERT` initialized the query

`INTO` name of the table where we want to insert data

`VALUES` Function to include the data we specified in the `INTO` command

Remember that the autogenerated commands don't need to be specified

EG - Create a new customer

`````postgresql
INSERT INTO customer(store_id,
                     first_name,
                     last_name,
                     email,
                     activebool,
                     active,
                     address_id)

VALUES (1,
        'Irving',
        'Suarez',
        'iasl96@msn.com',
        true,
        1,
        1);

-- [RETURN]: 1 row affected in 18 ms
``````

You can change the return statement with `RETURNING`

````postgresql
RETURNING *;

-- [RETURN]: Query with the col name(s) and value(s) you selected

-- Where * is the columns you want to return
````

#### Multiple

You can get multiple values adding commas between statements

EG

````postgresql
VALUES ('hola', 'como', 'estas'),
       ('bien', 'y', 'tú?');
````

### Update

**¡¡ Important: You need to always include a filter in your update. If not, you'll update all the instances inisde
your DB !!**

`UPDATE` + table name

`SET` and then a key (column) value, separated with comma

`WHERE` filter

`RETURNIG` query for the updated values to return

````postgresql
UPDATE customer
SET first_name = 'Juan',
    last_name  = 'Ramos'
WHERE customer_id = 606
RETURNING *;
````

### Delete

**¡¡ Important: You need to always include a filter in your delete query. If not, you'll update all the instances inisde
your DB !!**

# If you don't include a WHERE you can delete all the entries from your table. Pls stop

````postgresql
DELETE
FROM customer
WHERE customer_id = 603;
````
