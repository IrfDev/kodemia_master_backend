# Why?

Main repo for content, examples and exercises for the Backend master with Python at Kodemia. 

Where the directories are being order by date. Each one will includes:

- Homework directory
- Exercises/Demo directory
- Content.md: This can be per directory and it's how I understood the concepts
- Readme.md: Instructions or extra information about the directory


Noob stuff, there are not agregated value on this repo more than personal (for now).
